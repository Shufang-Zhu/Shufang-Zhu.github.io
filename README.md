# Dr. Shufang Zhu

I am a Research Associate at the [Dipartimento di Ingegneria Informatica, Automatica e Gestionale](http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/), [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/), working with [Prof. Giuseppe De Giacomo](http://www.diag.uniroma1.it//degiacom/) on his Advanced ERC project [WhiteMech](https://whitemech.github.io/).

I received my Ph.D. degree in 2020, at [East China Normal University (ECNU)](http://english.ecnu.edu.cn/), Shanghai, China, under the supervision of [Prof. Geguang Pu](https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/pgg_en). 

During my Ph.D., I got the scholarship from [Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC)](https://www.chinesescholarshipcouncil.com/) and studied as a visiting Ph.D. student (August 2016 to Feb 2018) at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Moshe Y. Vardi](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vardi/).
