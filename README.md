I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor in US terms) at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computer-science/), [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/). Additionally, I am an [Associate Member](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/shufang.zhu/) of the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/), [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). Prior to joining Liverpool, I was a Senior Research Associate at the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford, working with [Prof. Giuseppe De Giacomo](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/giuseppe.degiacomo/) on his Advanced ERC project [WhiteMech](https://whitemech.github.io/).
My expertise lies in the interdisciplinary research area of artificial intelligence (AI) and formal methods (FM), with a focus on **automated planning and synthesis**.

I received my Ph.D. degree in 2020, at [East China Normal University (ECNU)](http://english.ecnu.edu.cn/), Shanghai, China, under the supervision of [Prof. Geguang Pu](https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/_s43/pgg_en/main.psp). 
During my Ph.D., I got the scholarship from [Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC)](https://www.chinesescholarshipcouncil.com/) and studied as a visiting Ph.D. student (August 2016 to Feb 2018) at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Moshe Y. Vardi](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vardi/).

See [CV](cv/CV_Shufang_Zhu.pdf) for more details.
